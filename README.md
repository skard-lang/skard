# Skard Programming Language

**WARNING! Skard is currently in active development. Breaking changes will happen unannounced. Use at your own risk.**

Skard is (or rather will be) an embeddable type-safe scripting language syntactically inspired by Python spiced with C#.

## Subprojects

As of now this project consists of two parts (but more may come in the future):

### skard-lib

This is a library that will implement everything needed to embed **Skard** into your own project.

### skard-runtime

This is an implementation project built on top of **skard-lib** that serves as an example of using it but also can be used to directly interpret **Skard** stand-alone programs.

## Milestones

 - [x] Custom basic VM
 - [x] Lexing
 - [ ] Parsing

(More will be added along the way)
